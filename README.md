## Usage

This website can be used to look up basic notes about fundamental website desgin topics. There are four sections: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. They each contain notes related to their section heading. If I inspect the page, or navigate to the DevTools console, I can see the JavaScript functions I coded running. It lists all the topics I learned about so far, and randomly selects one to revisit.
